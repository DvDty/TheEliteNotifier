I actually couldn't sleep well knowing I blew 1:17 at the end of this run and didn't want to hype the new strat with such a bad run. This was decent run for not watching a lot of the cinema otherwise. I spent time tweaking the strat since this run as I knew the potential of the strat was much faster.",

While the luck of the firing range is kinda annoying, the pace is much more reasonable to do. It turns out that 1:15 is even possible with this route. The start was a little bit off, and you could have the lift close on you before going upstairs. The lift warp back down can be more yolo too. I modified the Dev shot to be slightly lower and to the right (compared to 45 shot) after I died on a solid run at the glass blowup spot earlier. Pretty yolo ending without turning RCP-120 on, but I wanted to make sure I got there in time after having to turn around the other way to avoid 2 K7 guards.",

I had a 21.10 obj 1 fade, so another sec can be potentially improved for that part (best fade is 20.6x, 19 might be possible with perfect warp?). Everything about this difficulty hinges on how fast you get obj 2 to complete. I had it at 51.45 on this run. The mistake I made after the lift warp down didn't matter either because of needing to wait for Carrington's Foster working on new weapon message to finish.

The alka warp is more difficult with this strat because you aren't getting the benefit of the lag from opening the holoroom door. I decided to keep high res on to make the warp more reasonable to do, but all this could probably be done with high res off if trying to avoid any pauses.",

Exit via the foyer is impossible due to the number of ground troops present. The transport will collect you and DR. Caroll from the helipad. I don't have to remind you to protect Dr. Caroll at all costs, Joanna. Cassandra and dataDyne are going to be throwing all the obstacles they can in your path to prevent you from getting Dr. Caroll out. Good luck. Fight your way aroud the foyer until you can get access to one of the lifts that will take you and Dr. Caroll to the upper floor of the building. We traced an order to shut down the only accessible elevator to a PC on the lowest floor of offices. You have to find that PC and change the order to get the elevator going again. There is a dataDyne security gunship circling the building which outguns your jumpships and will shoot you out of the sky. Terminate it with extreme prejudice, since it will be trying to do the same thing to you. We suspect that Cassandra has deployed her bodyguards to block the route to the helipad. It is almost certain that you'll be unable to avoid them, so expect serious resistance when you encounter them. Get to the helipad where your dropship will be waiting. And don't forget the FUCKING Dr Caroll. AND ALSO DON'T FORGET THE UNTIEEEDDDD JOANNAAAA DAAAARK.",

I will keep going as this is a pretty addicting level for now. I took about 1-2 hours to get this after 2:16, so the lure has some consistency if you don't get limping animations. I'm guessing once the big dogs (high OCJ players) get this strat down somewhere around 2:08ish will happen eventually but still early to really guage where the time will end up. I'm not really seeing 2:06 feasible at this point though that's for sure. For me personally 2:10-2:11 would be ideal.",

    "comment": "The level is broken! Hard to explain what is going on 2nd half of the level, but basically you just clip the wall just after the fake Pres mine throw by generating lag and then back up while using full lookdown to move quickly out of bounds using the sun as a good lineup to eventually load the final area of the level. I have no idea what's possible with this strat yet, but I can see around 4-5s of mistakes for sure. The biggest mistake was not doing the clip going backwards, but it's much more difficult to do that way. I could have looked down sooner and loaded the final area slightly earlier with a slightly more right turn after getting around the black corner you see in full lookdown before the end.",
